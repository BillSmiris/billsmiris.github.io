    "aboutSummaryText":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I am Vasilis Smyris, a full-stack software developer based in Athens, Greece. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Piraeus and have recently embarked on my career in software development. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in various programming languages, software development frameworks, and other technologies, both through my academic studies and personal projects. I possess a solid theoretical understanding of the principles of programming and a deep appreciation for the design of efficient, scalable and user-friendly software and the authoring of clean, reusable and maintainable code. My skillset includes front-end and back-end development, as well as a keen understanding of the infrastructure, in software and hardware, required to deploy complex applications. I specialize in the .NET Framework and the C# programming language, with a portfolio of desktop and web applications built using the plethora of the framework's project types.In addition, I have extensive experience with Python, which I use primarily for prototyping and exploring complex scientific topics. Recently, I have been expanding my horizons by delving into low-level problem-solving with C++, game development, and electronics.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most definitive culmination of the knowledge and skills I have gathered through the years, has been my university thesis, which touches upon smart home applications. The application developed for this project consists of a web server that works as the smart-home hub, which serves the users with a UI through web browser and facilitates the communication between them and the various smart devices in the network, developed using Blazor Webassembly, and a prototype smart RGB lamp device, built using a Raspberry Pi computer, Python and basic electronics knowledge. The highlight of the project is the creation of a protocol of communication between the devices and the server, which can facilitate the administration and control of the devices and the creation of UI pages for these purposes, independent of device type.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work as an IT Implementation Consultant at NCR Corporation, providing technical support for ATM solutions on a day-to-day basis. When I'm not working, I enjoy studying history and geography, editing photos and videos, working out, learning new languages, collecting and traveling. I'm always eager to collaborate on new projects, so please don't hesitate to <a href=\"#contact\">get in touch</a>.",
